### About

I am Andrei Klepatch, an eighteen year old nerd working as a developer while reading a lot, doing my best to keep learning, and playing a lot of Magic: The Gathering.

This page exists because marketing myself more seems like a good idea. I mean hell, the only one of my applications to a “good” job that went past initial stages did so because of my online presence. Beyond that I agree with Wu [here](https://wiresandstarlings.tumblr.com/post/182207225784/boats-ease-into-the-harbor-bearing-real), agree with Guzey [here](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/), and enjoy revisiting the mental state of past me.
