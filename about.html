<h3>About</h3>
<p>
    I am Andrei Klepatch, an eighteen year old nerd living in the states. Being too non-conformist for my own good I elected to light my future on fire by not pursuing higher education and am now working as a junior software developer while reading a lot, doing my best to keep learning, and playing a lot of Magic: The Gathering.

    This page exists because marketing myself more seems like a good idea. I mean hell, the only one of my applications to a “good” job that went past initial stages did so because of my online presence. Beyond that I agree with Wu <a href="https://wiresandstarlings.tumblr.com/post/182207225784/boats-ease-into-the-harbor-bearing-real">here</a>, agree with Guzey <a href="https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/">here</a>, and enjoy revisiting the mental state of past me.

    When looking at setting this up I was faced with some decision paralysis regarding the many possible tech stacks. Of course the solution to that was to make a MVP the first way I could think of. Consider this a V0.1 and if still looks the same in a month (this was written on 2022-04-21) then I am doing something wrong.
