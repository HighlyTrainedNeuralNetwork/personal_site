### On Against Victimhood

#### _2022-06-02_

*epistemic status: thinking out loud*

Lately I've been thinking about how I engage with social media. With Twitter specifically I've long used it as a way to "spew" and verbalize some of my feelings and anxieties. While the latter part of that functionality in some ways helps me feel that I am getting things of my chest I am not actually sure that it is a positive and I now believe that it may be doing me more harm than good.

The main frame I am currently looking at this through is the one offered by Falkovich in his [Against Victimhood](https://putanumonit.com/2020/09/12/against-victimhood/). To briefly summarize, in it he advocates against having victim be a part of your identity. Like a lot of works in this general sphere my main reaction too reading it was "This makes a ton of sense" but unlike many others it has really stuck with me in recent years and in fact I would give it a lot of credit for helping me stop being depressed. Even today I not infrequently push back certain modes of thinking by invoking this piece.

What I'm trying to get at is that I think the pattern my Twitter usage has fallen into may have a lot of the same downsides as seeing yourself as a victim in that it is auto catalytic and draining. In light of this I will aim to kill off the need to voice magic-related or not anxieties by going for a walk/run instead whenever I feel the urge to do so.
