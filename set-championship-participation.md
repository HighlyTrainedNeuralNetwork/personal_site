### On Competing in a Set Championship

#### _2022-05-21_


I ended the New Cappena set championship with a record of 5-9 and a bye. I put a lot of work into my preparation for this aiming to overcome the deficit of Historic experience and player skill that I was looking that and was able to make day two but unable to convert into the only meaningful 9-6 or higher record. Writing this now fresh off my last loss it's hard not to feel very defeated but I do believe that I did my best and am happy to not have entirely scrubbed.

Prior to my qualification for this event I had discussed a number of times the idea that competing in PTQs on Arena as opposed to MTGO may be worthwhile for long-term improvement despite the lower quality of opponents due to the fact that earning a qualification and going through the testing process associated with it would be educational in its own right. As I reflect on my experience now I unfortunately don't believe I learned much of anything on a macro level. If it will serve as a data point for informing the logistics of my future projects it will not be particularly meaningful. I would say that improvement directly associated with the game is also absent compared to me using my testing time to play regularly on MTGO.

Despite this I am still glad to have competed and had that experience as a box on a checklist if nothing else. Games in the event really do feel like nothing else with competitors actually caring. I still have outs of chaining my online play experience to paper MTG via my upcoming MOCS appearance but absent that it seems that the shift in OP may make the quitting process very easy for me by preventing me from playing in any remotely meaningful events.
