### On Phoenix in Pioneer

#### _2022-01-24_

I believe that Phoenix and Ascendancy are currently the best two decks in Pioneer and don't see that changing until the new set comes out. A number of options exist that punish their midrangey, card draw heavy play style but open events have enough garbage in them that I expect playing one of the level one decks to remain the best option.

Between those two options I would be hard pressed to tell you with any confidence which is better but personally favor Phoenix. This is really only because of the fact that after playing a lot of both Phoenix _feels_ a bit better to me and I have no great evidence to back me up. In any case, Phoenix is my tool of choice at the moment so I will put down some of my thoughts on it here.

To begin with I want to establish that I believe there are a lot of self-consistent ways to play this and most other decks. My influences when learning the deck led me down a certain path and now looking at say Ekerosses list I see a lot of problems but clearly Ekeross and others who disagree with me have done well for themselves so I would be hesitant to call myself right and them wrong.

With that out of the way I will now try to hit the main branches one hits when building and playing with the deck.

**Number of lands**

I believe that you have to play at least nineteen lands and from there some are playing an extra which is typically an MDFC. My own most recent list had a neat nineteen with an extra Stormcarved Coast relative to what most play. When playing the stock nineteen I felt that I felt that I was more often flooded on spells and struggling to find land drops than in the opposite situation and so nudged the count a bit.

**Number of Pieces of the Puzzle**

The card certainly ends up being awkward on occasion but is an insane setup piece and we have already paid the cost for it when it comes to deckbuilding. I would advocate for simply maxing it.

**The removal suite**

Apart from the forced four Lightning Axes I have no strong opinion on what the remaining removal slots should look like. I tentatively believe that cards which hit face are not neccesary.

**The delve spells**

At present I am on a 2/2 Treasure Cruise/Temporal Trespass split. I think I am closer to playing the third Trespass than the third Cruise because fork timewalk is insanely strong and because I like being less soft to Narset. Not really confident in either setup and could see going to zero for either of the them though the diversification is also appealing with how many cards we see.

**The sideboard planeswalkers**

I am very high on Narset and relatively low on Jace. I am still playing one Jace because it is a strong juke but is awkward enough of the time that I would not want more. I am on three Narset and am not insanely far from maxing it. The card is just extremely flexible with it hitting the mirror, Ascendancy, Lotus, and Control.

**Playing the deck**

I wish I had more to say here because it seems like what really matters. Phoenix feels like a Delver port to me though to be fair after going deep on Delver I feel that largs swathes of decks across all formats are just Delver ports. The one object level thing I would stress is carefully tracking and being flexible in regards to which of your wincons between Thing in the Ice, Phoenixes, and Timewalk you should be playing towards. Your lategame trumps what most people are doing but it is important to be cognizant of when that is not the case and you need to race much more than you typically would.
